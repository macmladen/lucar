# Debugging
#

# Default Sass 3.4:  =>  --sourcemap      (produce  {filename}.map)
# If disabled,       =>  --debug-info     (produce  @media -sass-debug-info{filename... )
# If disabled        =>  --line-comments  (produce  /* line 29, ../../sas )
# If disabled        =>  no debug info :)

# If in development (set above), we can turn on the sourcemap file generation.
# Supported natively in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, the best way to debug
# Requires sass 3.3+ and compass 1.0.1+
# Determine version from command line: sass --version && compass --version
# May be supplied on command line, --no-sourcemap or --sourcemap
#sourcemap = false

# Alternative development debugging methods
# If in development (above), we can enable line_comments for FireCompass plugin.
# Requires Firebug plugin and FireCompass plugin

#firecompass = true

# If in development (above), we can enable debug_info for the FireSass plugin.
# Requires Firebug plugin and Firesass plugin
